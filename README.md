Meetup Review
```````
* What was the name of the tech event?
  * Portland JavaScript Admirers' Monthly Meeting   

* What date did it occur?
  * September 26, 2018

* Who/what organization coordinated the event?
  * Portland JavaScript Admirers

* If there were speakers, who spoke?
  * Faddah Wolf & Peter Ajtal

* What was the format of the event?
  * Informal meeting with two speakers in a loose but organized format. Each talk was followed by a round of questions. Networking followed for about an hour. They served pizza and asked for volunteers to help run the meetup. I volunteered and hope to hear back from one of the co-organizers of the group.

* What was the topic or main focus of the event?
  * We learned about building an express API with Swagger and a stupid javascript trick by Faddah

* What made you want to attend this particular event?
  * I have a lot of appreciation for JavaScript, it is an incredibly versatile and formidable language. I wanted to join the Portland Js admirer's group since I hope by surrounding myself with experts in this language I can get inspired to learn more and also be around the types of mentors who can help my understanding of Js after Epicodus is over.

* What was the highlight of the event?
  * Jokes aside, besides the pizza, it was an engaging event with energized and concise well organized talks. The speakers had well made slides and their presentations were educational without being overwhelming or pedantic.

* What did you learn from this experience?
  * With the swagger presentation, I was able to see that you could set up an application with built in controllers, methods, and routes with a few simple command lines. I saw a talk about AWS where the presenter set up an application within 15 minutes, it was great to see that the equivalent can be done in JavaScript. Plus, I really like the name Swagger.

* If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)
  * I think it was an excellent meetup, well organized and friendly. They had refreshments and an easy going mood where it was not intimidating to talk to people who are experts in the field and made networking very effortless and easy. The venue, the mood, the talks, and the level of ease made this meet up mentally and psychologically very pleasing. I would definitely love to go back.

* Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?
  * 10/10 would recommend my peers go to this meetup.

* Is there anything else that stood out about the event?
  * The fact that one of the co-organizers was an Epicodus alumni that I recognized.
