Meetup Review

* What was the name of the tech event?
  * Portland JavaScript Admirers' Monthly Meeting   

* What date did it occur?
  * September 26, 2018

* Who/what organization coordinated the event?
  * Portland JavaScript Admirers

* If there were speakers, who spoke?
  * Faddah Wolf & Peter Ajtal

* What was the format of the event?
  * Informal meeting with two speakers in a loose but organized format. Each talk was followed by a round of questions. Networking followed for about an hour. They served pizza and asked for volunteers to help run the meetup. I volunteered and hope to hear back from one of the co-organizers of the group.

* What was the topic or main focus of the event?
  * We learned about building an express API with Swagger and a stupid javascript trick by Faddah

* What made you want to attend this particular event?
  * I have a lot of appreciation for JavaScript, it is an incredibly versatile and formidable language. I wanted to join the Portland Js admirer's group since I hope by surrounding myself with experts in this language I can get inspired to learn more and also be around the types of mentors who can help my understanding of Js after Epicodus is over.

* What was the highlight of the event?
